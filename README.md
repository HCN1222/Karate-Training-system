# Karate-Training-system
This is a Karate training system built with Python script, Arduino Uno board, and IMU.

We have built a Karate training system that can help the user to improve their Karate skills. The system is built with Python script, Arduino Uno board, and IMU. The system can detect the user's movement and provide feedback on the user's performance. It also detects the number of times practiced.

For detailed information, please refer to the [report](./運動感測期末專題報告_第四組.pdf).
